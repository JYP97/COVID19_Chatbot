# COVID19_Chatbot
DLAM Project

## 1. What is our topic?  
We want to create a chatbot. In the dialogue, the user can ask questions about COVID-19 and the robot will give
the appropriate answers. Questions related to COVID-19 can be asked in multiple languages, and their corresponding
answers will be in the same ones. That is to say, by talking to the chatbot, users can get information about COVID-19,
such as news, public health and community discussions, this greatly increases the dissemination of COVID-19 knowledge.
(In fact, it is not intended to be used in a clinical setting, and should not be used to influence clinical outcomes.)  
Moreover, since we call it a chatbot and not a simple question and answer system, it is certain that an interactive
dialogue can take place between the user and the bot. For this reason, we will integrate common answers to everyday
questions into the system as well, such as greetings.
